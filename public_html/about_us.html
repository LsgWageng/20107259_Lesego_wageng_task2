        <P align="middle">
            Joe's and Son services was initially meant to be a small local mechanic business but as we noticed the pandemic impacted our neighbors financially and people ended up not being able to repair their cars.<br>
            Therefore we decided to teach drop out students and retrenched workers basic car maintenance such as checking water and oil, spark plugs, timing belts, clutches and other basic services.<br>
            Three months later everyone around Hartbeesfontein wanted to be part of the Joe's and Son services and enroll in our organization.<br>
        </P>
        
        <h1 align="middle" style="color: darkcyan">OUR VISION</h1>

        <h1 align="middle" style="color: darkcyan">OUR MISSION</h1>
        
        <p align="middle">
